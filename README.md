# üì∞ AI News Auto-Poster with OpenAI API (PHP + MySQL)

## üëã Hello and Welcome!

Hey there! üëã  
Thanks for visiting this project. I built it to help fellow developers, content creators, and AI enthusiasts like you automate the generation and publishing of news articles using OpenAI‚Äôs API. This script fetches fresh, Kenya-relevant news articles in categories like Technology, Politics, Medicine, Education, Business, and Entertainment ‚Äî and inserts them straight into your database.

No more writing boilerplate news manually. The script generates AI-powered content, checks for duplicates, and logs what it inserted ‚Äî all in a cron-job-friendly format. Whether you‚Äôre running a blog, a content site, or building a news aggregator, this should save you serious time.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. The PHP script loops through your selected news categories.
2. For each category, it calls OpenAI‚Äôs GPT model with a writing prompt.
3. It receives and parses 3 articles (each with a title and body).
4. It checks the database for duplicates (by title).
5. It inserts only fresh articles into the `gonews` table.
6. Logs are saved in `cron_news.log` to track each run.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before running the script:

1. Replace the following placeholders in the script:
   - `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME` ‚Äì your MySQL DB config
   - `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` ‚Äì your OpenAI API key

2. Ensure the following MySQL table exists:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `gonews` (
  `id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `category` VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
  `title` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `slug` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `content` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `author_id` INT(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `featured_image` VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL,
  `is_top` TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0,
  `status` ENUM('draft','published','archived') DEFAULT 'draft',
  `created_at` DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  `updated_at` DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 COLLATE=latin1_swedish_ci;
